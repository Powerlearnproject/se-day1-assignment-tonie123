Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
software engineering is a branch of a computer science  used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
importance of technology industry:Realiability it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications.
efficiency-it helps to optimize develop workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
security-implement protection practice like authentication,authorisation and encryption to secure users information 
scalability and flexibility- it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance 



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
. mastering process
.mastering machine 
.mastering  complexity

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning-Identify the software requirement or purpose and scope 
2.Design-building the framework 
3.coding converting software design into tangible code 
4.Testing- examine the software for any bugs and glitches 
5.software Developer- developing applications,programming languages and frameworks 
6.project manager- assembles and lead the software development team 
7.Agile methodology-iterative and incremental,with multiple cycles (sprints)
8.Waterfall methodology-linear and sequential each phase is completed before moving on there is low flexibility 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology- linear and sequential each phase is completed before moving on there is flexibility
I.e changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete
testing is done at the end of the development process
Agile methodology- iterative and incremental with multiple cycles (sprints)
I.e high flexibility adapts to changing requirements
regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- developing applications programs and systems using programming languages and frameworking 
Quality Assurance Engineer- collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements 
Project Manager- assembles and lead the software development team

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment(IDE)-is software platform that facilitates the creation of other software application by providing a space to write
I.e an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing 
an IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified languages that operating system can understand 
Version Control Systems(VCS)-Are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time 
I.e
collaboration enables multiple development to work on the same codebase without conflicts 
changing tracking records detailed history of changes allowing easy analysis of each modification 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.

 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.

 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements,

Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.

- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Importance:

Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.

Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.

Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.

Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.

Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
